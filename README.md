## For user
Thanks for cloning my project. This is a small python based multiple processor framework for python user, you can define your own processor function and, of course deploy it into the multiprocessor manager. Then it can automatically distribute and allocate the nodes, to execute among clusters of machine or only one machine for more than one processes.

## Main Features
 - user-friendly multiple processor API, all you need to do is define a rollup function to execute all the task in one thread. The multiprocessor manager will automatically exert this function on multiple processors.
 - user-friendly distributed processing API.
